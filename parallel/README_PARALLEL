Instructions for parallel execution of APhiD software.
========================================================================
0.  Consult the manpage.
1.  build mesh file: compile gen_mesh.f90; a.out > aphid.mesh
2.  edit aphid_mpi.input for source specification, QMR parameters, etc
3.  if using a dipole source (operation mode 5), edit aphid_mpi.source
    for electric dipole orientations and the (i,j,k) index of their
    tail ends.
4.  set environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to either 1 or 4, depending
    on whether multi-threading is wanted or not.
5.  type aphid_mpi at the command line and wait... (*)
6.  fields and outputs are given in VTK file format.  Parse as needed
    for plotting and analysis.

(*)  outut for each of the MPI processes is redirected to subdirectory
    'tmp-n' where n is the MPI process ID + 1.  The usual streaming
    output seen in serial code execution is redirected to unit 1000+n
    in the parent directory.  This file is handled differently by the 
    various FORTRAN compilers.  For example, gfortran calls this file 
    'fort.100n'.
