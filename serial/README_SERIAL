Instructions for serial execution of APhiD software.
========================================================================
0.  consult the manpage
1.  build mesh file: compile gen_mesh.f90; a.out > aphid.mesh
2.  edit aphid.input for source specification, QMR parameters, etc
3.  if using a dipole source (operation mode 5), edit aphid.source
    for electric dipole orientations and the (i,j,k) index of their
    tail ends.
4.  set environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS to either 1 or 4, depending
    on whether multi-threading is wanted or not.
5.  type aphid_serial at the command line and wait... (*)
6.  fields and outputs are given in VTK file format.  Parse as needed
    for plotting and analysis.

(*) alternatively, the various input filds aphid.* could be dropped into
a directory 'pwd' other than the working one. If that's the case, then
use the command line option '-wd pwd' to redirect vtk output.
